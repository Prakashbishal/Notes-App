# Notes App

## Overview

Welcome to the Notes App! This Android application provides an interactive user interface for managing your notes efficiently. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, offering a structured and organized approach to application development.

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: The app offers a user-friendly interface, making it easy and intuitive to manage your notes.

- **Swipe Actions**:
  - Swipe right to delete a note.
  - Swipe left to update a note.

## Architecture

The app is built using the MVVM architecture, which separates the application logic into three components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.

- **View**: Displays the user interface and interacts with the user.

- **ViewModel**: Acts as a mediator between the View and the Model, handling user input and updating the UI accordingly.

This architectural pattern enhances maintainability, scalability, and testability of the codebase.

## Usage

1. **Delete Note**: Swipe right on a note in the list to delete it.

2. **Update Note**: Swipe left on a note in the list to update its content.

3. **MVVM Structure**: The codebase follows the MVVM architecture, providing a clear separation of concerns and promoting a modular and maintainable code structure.
